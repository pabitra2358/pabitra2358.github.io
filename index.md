Hi! I am a PhD student in Economics at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), USA, with research interests in Empirical Industrial Organization and Health Economics.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Analyst at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in New Delhi and the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University in Bangalore. I was also associated with iHEAR-Sangath in Bhopal, where I worked on vaccine equity issues among LGBTQ+ populations in India. I hold BA and MA in Economics from Jadavpur University, India.
