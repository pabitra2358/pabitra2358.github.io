Hi! I am a PhD student in Economics at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), USA. I am interested in Empirical Industrial Organisation and Health Economics.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Analyst at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in New Delhi and the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India. Additionally, I have been associated with iHEAR-Sangath in Bhopal working on vaccine equity issues with lgbtq+ population in India. I received a master's degree in economics from Jadavpur University, India.
